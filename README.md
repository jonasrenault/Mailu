This fork of Mailu modifies

- the admin container to add a configuration option `WEB_SSO_PREFIX` which updates the url_path for `sso` and `static` routes served by the admin web app
- the unbound container to add a forward rule to the host DNS
- adds labels to push these modified images to github's package container

Follow the [doc on mailu](https://mailu.io/2.0/contributors/environment.html#building-images) to build the docker images and push them to github's container registry:

- Create a token on github with write access for containers and use this token to login to github's container registry.
```console
export CR_PAT=YOUR_TOKEN
echo $CR_PAT | docker login ghcr.io -u USERNAME --password-stdin
```

- Set the `DOCKER_ORG` and `MAILU_VERSION` env vars

```console
export DOCKER_ORG="ghcr.io/jonasrenault"
export MAILU_VERSION="2.0.30"
export MAILU_PINNED_VERSION="2.0.30"
```

- Build and push the docker images

```console
docker buildx bake -f tests/build.hcl --push admin resolver
```
